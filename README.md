Implements Minesweeper game, handling flagging, bombing, displaying, and winning within a command-line interface.

Implements Minesweeper's "chain reveal" function, and allows unflagging of tiles.

Saves game by storing Minesweeper object in YAML serialization. 

Load game from YAML by specificing filename at command line (e.g. ruby minesweeper.rb "minesweeper_040714.yaml").
